/**
 * Enum in Java
 * Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming
 * language.
 * In Java (from 1.5), enums are represented using enum data type.
 * Java enums are more powerful than C/C++ enums.
 * In Java, we can also add variables, methods and constructors to it.
 * the main objective of enum is to define our own data types (Enumerated Data Types).
 * Enum declaration can be done outside a class or inside a class but not inside a method.
